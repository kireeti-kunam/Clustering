# Clustering On Graph Data:

## Credits: https://www.appliedaicourse.com/ 

## prerequisites:
 - Basics of python3
 - Networkx library
 - T-sne (for visualization)
 - Clustering algorithms (k-means)

## Summary:

 - This is my project at applied ai course. In this project we are preforming clustering on manually generated graph(bipartite) data. 
 - By using connceted components and random walk we represented eah node which are movie or actor node in our dataset we taken maximum length of 100.
 - Now by using word2vec we represented each node such as movie and actor node in 128 dimenssion vector/embedding.
 - we visualized this data in 2d by using t-sne (Dimenssionality reduction)
 - We applied clustering algorith on actor nodes and movie nnodes.
